  "solution": "To solve the integral of the expression \\( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) + x^{12} \\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Integrate \\( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) \\)**:\n   We can use a substitution method. Let \\( u = \\sin(x) \\), then \\( du = \\cos(x) dx \\). The integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) \\, dx = \\int u^2 \\, du = \\frac{u^3}{3} + C = \\frac{\\sin(x)^3}{3} + C\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integrate \\( x^{12} \\)**:\n   The integral of \\( x^{12} \\) is straightforward:\n   \\[\n   \\int x^{12} \\, dx = \\frac{x^{13}}{13} + C\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine both results:\n\\[\n\\int \\left( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) + x^{12} \\right) \\, dx = \\frac{\\sin(x)^3}{3} + \\frac{x^{13}}{13}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<answer>(sin(x)**3/3 + x**13/13)</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, we will analyze each part of the integration process step by step.\n\n1. **Integrating \\( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) \\)**:\n   - The substitution \\( u = \\sin(x) \\) is appropriate, as it simplifies the integral. The differential \\( du = \\cos(x) dx \\) is also correctly identified.\n   - The integral transforms as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\int \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) \\, dx = \\int u^2 \\, du\n     \\]\n   - The integral of \\( u^2 \\) is correctly computed:\n     \\[\n     \\int u^2 \\, du = \\frac{u^3}{3} + C = \\frac{\\sin(x)^3}{3} + C\n     \\]\n   - This part of the solution is correct.\n\n2. **Integrating \\( x^{12} \\)**:\n   - The integral of \\( x^{12} \\) is straightforward and is computed correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\int x^{12} \\, dx = \\frac{x^{13}}{13} + C\n     \\]\n   - This part of the solution is also correct.\n\n3. **Combining the Results**:\n   - The final step combines both integrals:\n     \\[\n     \\int \\left( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) + x^{12} \\right) \\, dx = \\frac{\\sin(x)^3}{3} + \\frac{x^{13}}{13} + C\n     \\]\n   - The solution correctly combines the results from both parts, although it should be noted that the constant of integration \\( C \\) should only appear once in the final answer, not separately for each integral.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer presented is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\sin(x)^3}{3} + \\frac{x^{13}}{13}\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but it is important to note that the constant of integration should be included in the final answer as a single constant \\( C \\).\n\nOverall, the solution correctly integrates both parts of the expression and combines them appropriately. The only minor issue is the omission of a single constant of integration in the final answer, but this does not affect the correctness of the integral itself.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
