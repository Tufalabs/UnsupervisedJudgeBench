  "question": "Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the day of the week on Lucy's 1000th day of life, given that she was born on a Wednesday.\n\n1. **Determine the number of weeks and extra days in 1000 days:**\n   - 1000 days can be divided into weeks and extra days. Since a week has 7 days, we perform the division:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\text{ weeks with a remainder of } 6 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n   - This means 1000 days is equivalent to 142 full weeks and 6 additional days.\n\n2. **Calculate the day of the week:**\n   - Lucy was born on a Wednesday. After 142 full weeks, it would still be a Wednesday because 142 weeks is a multiple of 7 days.\n   - We then add the 6 extra days to Wednesday:\n     - Thursday (1 day after Wednesday)\n     - Friday (2 days after Wednesday)\n     - Saturday (3 days after Wednesday)\n     - Sunday (4 days after Wednesday)\n     - Monday (5 days after Wednesday)\n     - Tuesday (6 days after Wednesday)\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the 1000th day of Lucy's life falls on a Tuesday.\n\nThus, the day of the week on which Lucy's parents held the party is:\n\n<ANSWER>Tuesday</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution, let's go through the steps provided and verify their correctness:\n\n1. **Determine the number of weeks and extra days in 1000 days:**\n   - The solution correctly divides 1000 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remainder:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\text{ weeks with a remainder of } 6 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n   - This calculation is correct. 1000 days indeed consist of 142 full weeks and 6 additional days.\n\n2. **Calculate the day of the week:**\n   - Lucy was born on a Wednesday. After 142 full weeks, it would still be a Wednesday because 142 weeks is a multiple of 7 days. This reasoning is correct.\n   - The solution then adds the 6 extra days to Wednesday:\n     - Thursday (1 day after Wednesday)\n     - Friday (2 days after Wednesday)\n     - Saturday (3 days after Wednesday)\n     - Sunday (4 days after Wednesday)\n     - Monday (5 days after Wednesday)\n     - Tuesday (6 days after Wednesday)\n   - The addition of days is correctly performed, leading to the conclusion that the 1000th day is a Tuesday.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The solution concludes that the 1000th day of Lucy's life falls on a Tuesday, which is consistent with the calculations.\n\nThe solution correctly follows the logical steps to determine the day of the week for Lucy's 1000th day of life. Each step is accurate, and the final conclusion is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>\n\nThe solution is correct, as it accurately calculates the day of the week for the 1000th day of Lucy's life, given the initial conditions.",
