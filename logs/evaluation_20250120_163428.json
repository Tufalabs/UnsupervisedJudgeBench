  "question": "If two distinct members of the set $\\{ 3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51 \\}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 63? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the product of two distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{ 3, 7, 21, 27, 35, 42, 51 \\}\\) is a multiple of 63. First, let's factor 63:\n\n\\[\n63 = 3^2 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nFor the product of two numbers to be a multiple of 63, it must include at least two factors of 3 and one factor of 7.\n\n### Step 1: Identify numbers with factors of 3 and 7\n\n**Numbers with factors of 3:**\n- 3 (\\(3^1\\))\n- 21 (\\(3^1 \\times 7^1\\))\n- 27 (\\(3^3\\))\n- 42 (\\(3^1 \\times 7^1\\))\n- 51 (\\(3^1 \\times 17\\))\n\n**Numbers with factors of 7:**\n- 7 (\\(7^1\\))\n- 21 (\\(3^1 \\times 7^1\\))\n- 35 (\\(5 \\times 7^1\\))\n- 42 (\\(3^1 \\times 7^1\\))\n\n### Step 2: Determine pairs that result in a product with at least \\(3^2 \\times 7\\)\n\nTo ensure the product is a multiple of 63, we need:\n- At least two factors of 3\n- At least one factor of 7\n\n**Case 1: One number provides \\(3^2\\) and the other provides \\(7\\)**\n\n- 27 provides \\(3^2\\). Pair it with any number that provides 7:\n  - 27 and 7\n  - 27 and 21\n  - 27 and 35\n  - 27 and 42\n\n**Case 2: Both numbers provide \\(3^1\\) and at least one provides 7**\n\n- Choose two numbers from \\(\\{3, 21, 42, 51\\}\\) such that at least one provides 7:\n  - 3 and 21\n  - 3 and 42\n  - 21 and 42\n  - 21 and 51\n\n### Step 3: Count the successful pairs\n\nFrom the above cases, the successful pairs are:\n- (27, 7)\n- (27, 21)\n- (27, 35)\n- (27, 42)\n- (3, 21)\n- (3, 42)\n- (21, 42)\n- (21, 51)\n\nThis gives us a total of 8 successful pairs.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number of possible pairs\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from the set of 7 numbers is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the probability\n\nThe probability that the product is a multiple of 63 is the number of successful pairs divided by the total number of pairs:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{21}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of two randomly selected numbers from the set is a multiple of 63 is \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{8}{21}\\)</ANSWER>",

  "explanation": "To determine if the solution is correct, let's evaluate each step of the solution provided:\n\n1. **Factorization of 63**: The solution correctly factors 63 as \\(63 = 3^2 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Identification of numbers with factors of 3 and 7**:\n   - Numbers with factors of 3: 3, 21, 27, 42, 51. This is correct.\n   - Numbers with factors of 7: 7, 21, 35, 42. This is also correct.\n\n3. **Determining pairs that result in a product with at least \\(3^2 \\times 7\\)**:\n   - **Case 1**: One number provides \\(3^2\\) and the other provides 7.\n     - 27 provides \\(3^2\\). The pairs listed (27, 7), (27, 21), (27, 35), (27, 42) are correct.\n   - **Case 2**: Both numbers provide \\(3^1\\) and at least one provides 7.\n     - The pairs listed (3, 21), (3, 42), (21, 42), (21, 51) are correct.\n\n4. **Counting the successful pairs**: The solution correctly identifies 8 successful pairs.\n\n5. **Calculating the total number of possible pairs**: The solution correctly calculates the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from the set of 7 numbers as \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\).\n\n6. **Calculating the probability**: The solution correctly calculates the probability as \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\).\n\nThe solution follows a logical and correct approach to determine the probability that the product of two randomly selected numbers from the set is a multiple of 63. Each step is verified to be accurate, and the final answer is consistent with the analysis.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
