  "question": "A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the scenario: when a standard six-sided die is rolled, one face is hidden, and the other five faces are visible. The product \\( P \\) is the product of the numbers on these five visible faces. We need to find the largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) regardless of which face is hidden.\n\nA standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6. The sum of all the numbers on the die is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\n\nIf a number \\( x \\) is on the hidden face, then the sum of the numbers on the visible faces is \\( 21 - x \\). Therefore, the product \\( P \\) of the numbers on the visible faces is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{6!}{x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( 6! = 720 \\) is the product of all the numbers from 1 to 6.\n\nWe need to determine the largest number that divides \\( P \\) for any \\( x \\) from 1 to 6. Let's calculate \\( P \\) for each possible hidden face:\n\n1. If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{1} = 720 \\).\n2. If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{2} = 360 \\).\n3. If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{3} = 240 \\).\n4. If \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{4} = 180 \\).\n5. If \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{5} = 144 \\).\n6. If \\( x = 6 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{6} = 120 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these values: 720, 360, 240, 180, 144, and 120.\n\nLet's find the prime factorizations:\n\n- \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 240 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\nThe GCD is determined by taking the lowest power of each prime that appears in all factorizations:\n\n- For \\( 2 \\), the lowest power is \\( 2^2 \\).\n- For \\( 3 \\), the lowest power is \\( 3^1 \\).\n- For \\( 5 \\), the lowest power is \\( 5^0 \\) (since 144 does not have a factor of 5).\n\nThus, the GCD is:\n\n\\[\n2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) for any roll of the die is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>12</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly addresses the problem of finding the largest number that is certain to divide the product \\( P \\) of the five visible faces of a standard six-sided die, regardless of which face is hidden.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The solution begins by correctly identifying that when a die is rolled, one face is hidden, and the product \\( P \\) is calculated from the visible faces. The approach of using \\( P = \\frac{6!}{x} \\) is valid, where \\( x \\) is the number on the hidden face.\n\n2. **Calculating \\( P \\)**: The calculations for \\( P \\) for each possible hidden face (1 through 6) are correctly executed:\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( P = 720 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( P = 360 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( P = 240 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 4 \\), \\( P = 180 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 5 \\), \\( P = 144 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 6 \\), \\( P = 120 \\)\n\n3. **Finding the GCD**: The solution then correctly identifies the need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the calculated values. The prime factorizations of each \\( P \\) value are accurately provided:\n   - \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 240 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\)\n   - \\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\n4. **Calculating the GCD**: The GCD is determined correctly by taking the lowest power of each prime factor:\n   - For \\( 2 \\), the lowest power is \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - For \\( 3 \\), the lowest power is \\( 3^1 \\).\n   - For \\( 5 \\), the lowest power is \\( 5^0 \\) (since 144 does not include 5).\n\n   Thus, the GCD is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The conclusion that the largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) is \\( 12 \\) is correct.\n\nOverall, the solution is logically sound, follows the correct mathematical procedures, and arrives at the correct conclusion.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
