  "question": "A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the scenario: when a standard six-sided die is rolled, one face is hidden, and the other five faces are visible. The product \\( P \\) is the product of the numbers on these five visible faces. We need to find the largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) regardless of which face is hidden.\n\nA standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6. The sum of all the numbers on the die is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\n\nIf a number \\( x \\) is on the hidden face, then the sum of the numbers on the visible faces is \\( 21 - x \\). Therefore, the product \\( P \\) of the numbers on the visible faces is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{6!}{x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( 6! = 720 \\) is the product of all the numbers from 1 to 6.\n\nWe need to determine the largest number that divides \\( P \\) for any \\( x \\) from 1 to 6. Let's calculate \\( P \\) for each possible hidden face:\n\n1. If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{1} = 720 \\).\n2. If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{2} = 360 \\).\n3. If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{3} = 240 \\).\n4. If \\( x = 4 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{4} = 180 \\).\n5. If \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{5} = 144 \\).\n6. If \\( x = 6 \\), then \\( P = \\frac{720}{6} = 120 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these values: 720, 360, 240, 180, 144, and 120.\n\nLet's find the prime factorizations:\n\n- \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 240 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n- \\( 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\nThe GCD is determined by taking the lowest power of each prime that appears in all factorizations:\n\n- For \\( 2 \\), the lowest power is \\( 2^2 \\).\n- For \\( 3 \\), the lowest power is \\( 3^1 \\).\n- For \\( 5 \\), the lowest power is \\( 5^0 \\) (since 144 does not have a factor of 5).\n\nThus, the GCD is:\n\n\\[\n2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) for any roll of the die is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>12</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided is correct, and I will verify each step to ensure its accuracy.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves rolling a six-sided die and finding the largest number that is certain to divide the product of the five visible numbers, \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Sum of Numbers on a Die**: The sum of the numbers on a standard six-sided die is correctly calculated as \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 \\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\( P \\)**: The product of all six numbers is \\( 6! = 720 \\). The product \\( P \\) of the five visible numbers is given by \\( P = \\frac{720}{x} \\), where \\( x \\) is the hidden number. This expression is correct.\n\n4. **Calculating \\( P \\) for Each Hidden Face**:\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( P = 720 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( P = 360 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( P = 240 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 4 \\), \\( P = 180 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 5 \\), \\( P = 144 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 6 \\), \\( P = 120 \\).\n\n   These calculations are correct.\n\n5. **Prime Factorizations**:\n   - \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 240 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - \\( 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\)\n   - \\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\n   These factorizations are correct.\n\n6. **Finding the GCD**:\n   - The lowest power of 2 across all factorizations is \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - The lowest power of 3 is \\( 3^1 \\).\n   - The lowest power of 5 is \\( 5^0 \\) (since 144 does not have a factor of 5).\n\n   Therefore, the GCD is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\) for any roll of the die is indeed 12.\n\nThe solution is logically sound, and all calculations and reasoning steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
