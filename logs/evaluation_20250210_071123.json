  "question": "If $|x-2|=p$, where $x<2$, then what is $x-p$ in terms of $p$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[\n|x - 2| = p\n\\]\n\nWe are also given the condition that \\(x < 2\\). The absolute value equation \\(|x - 2| = p\\) can be split into two cases:\n\n1. \\(x - 2 = p\\)\n2. \\(x - 2 = -p\\)\n\nSince we have the condition \\(x < 2\\), we need to consider which case is applicable. \n\n### Case 1: \\(x - 2 = p\\)\n\nIf \\(x - 2 = p\\), then:\n\n\\[\nx = p + 2\n\\]\n\nHowever, substituting \\(x = p + 2\\) into the condition \\(x < 2\\) gives:\n\n\\[\np + 2 < 2 \\implies p < 0\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the fact that \\(p\\) is the absolute value of a real number, which must be non-negative (\\(p \\geq 0\\)). Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n### Case 2: \\(x - 2 = -p\\)\n\nIf \\(x - 2 = -p\\), then:\n\n\\[\nx = -p + 2\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if this satisfies the condition \\(x < 2\\):\n\n\\[\n-p + 2 < 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n\\[\n-p < 0 \\implies p > 0\n\\]\n\nThis is consistent with \\(p\\) being non-negative, and since \\(p\\) is the absolute value, \\(p\\) can be zero or positive. However, since we derived \\(p > 0\\), this case is valid when \\(p > 0\\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\(x - p\\) in terms of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\nx = -p + 2\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nx - p = (-p + 2) - p = -2p + 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expression for \\(x - p\\) in terms of \\(p\\) is:\n\n\\[\nx - p = 2 - 2p\n\\]\n\nFinally, we present the answer in the required format:\n\n<ANSWER>2 - 2p</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided, we need to verify each step and ensure that the final expression for \\(x - p\\) is correct given the conditions of the problem.\n\n1. **Understanding the Absolute Value Equation**: The equation given is \\(|x - 2| = p\\). Since we know that \\(x < 2\\), we can conclude that \\(|x - 2| = -(x - 2) = 2 - x\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \\[\n   2 - x = p\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   x = 2 - p\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding \\(x - p\\)**: Now, we need to find \\(x - p\\):\n   \\[\n   x - p = (2 - p) - p = 2 - 2p\n   \\]\n\n3. **Checking the Conditions**: The solution correctly identifies that since \\(x < 2\\), we must consider the case where \\(x - 2 = -p\\). The solution also correctly concludes that \\(p\\) must be greater than 0 for this case to hold, which is consistent with the definition of absolute value.\n\n4. **Final Expression**: The final expression derived in the solution is \\(x - p = 2 - 2p\\). This matches our derived expression from the absolute value consideration.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The solution correctly follows the logic of the problem, checks the conditions, and arrives at the correct expression for \\(x - p\\) in terms of \\(p\\).\n\nGiven that all steps are logically sound and the final expression is correct, I conclude that the solution is accurate.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
