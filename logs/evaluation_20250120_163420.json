  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the red stripe painted on the cylindrical silo. The stripe makes two complete revolutions around the silo, and we need to find the area of this helical stripe.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Circumference of the Silo:**\n   The silo is cylindrical with a diameter of 30 feet. The circumference \\( C \\) of the base of the cylinder is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\pi \\times \\text{diameter} = \\pi \\times 30 = 30\\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the Path of the Stripe:**\n   The stripe makes two complete revolutions around the silo. This means the stripe travels a total vertical distance equal to the height of the silo, which is 80 feet, while making two complete horizontal revolutions.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of the Stripe:**\n   Since the stripe makes two complete revolutions, the total horizontal distance covered by the stripe is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total horizontal distance} = 2 \\times \\text{circumference} = 2 \\times 30\\pi = 60\\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Stripe:**\n   The stripe is essentially a rectangle that wraps around the cylinder. The width of the stripe is 3 feet, and the length of the stripe is the total horizontal distance it covers, which is \\( 60\\pi \\) feet.\n\n   The area \\( A \\) of the stripe is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{width} \\times \\text{length} = 3 \\times 60\\pi = 180\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The area of the red stripe is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{180\\pi} \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the stripe in square feet is:\n\n<ANSWER>180\\pi</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution, let's go through each step and verify its correctness:\n\n1. **Determine the Circumference of the Silo:**\n   - The solution correctly calculates the circumference of the silo using the formula \\( C = \\pi \\times \\text{diameter} \\).\n   - Given the diameter is 30 feet, the circumference is \\( 30\\pi \\) feet. This step is correct.\n\n2. **Understand the Path of the Stripe:**\n   - The solution correctly identifies that the stripe makes two complete revolutions around the silo, covering a vertical distance equal to the height of the silo, which is 80 feet. This understanding is correct.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of the Stripe:**\n   - The solution calculates the total horizontal distance covered by the stripe as \\( 2 \\times \\text{circumference} = 2 \\times 30\\pi = 60\\pi \\) feet. This calculation is correct.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of the Stripe:**\n   - The solution treats the stripe as a rectangle with a width of 3 feet and a length of \\( 60\\pi \\) feet.\n   - The area is calculated as \\( 3 \\times 60\\pi = 180\\pi \\) square feet. This calculation is correct.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The solution concludes that the area of the red stripe is \\( 180\\pi \\) square feet, which is consistent with the calculations.\n\nEach step in the solution is logically sound and mathematically correct. The solution correctly applies the concepts of geometry to determine the area of the stripe on the cylindrical silo.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
