  "question": "How many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find how many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product \\( N = \\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right) \\).\n\nA perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as \\( k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.\n\nFirst, let's express \\( N \\) in its prime factorization form:\n\\[\nN = 2^{10} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^{15}\n\\]\n\nA factor of \\( N \\) will have the form \\( 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\), where \\( 0 \\leq a \\leq 10 \\), \\( 0 \\leq b \\leq 12 \\), and \\( 0 \\leq c \\leq 15 \\).\n\nFor this factor to be a perfect square, the exponents \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) must all be even. Let's determine the possible values for each exponent:\n\n1. **Exponent \\( a \\):**  \n   \\( a \\) can be any even number from 0 to 10. The even numbers in this range are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  \n   Thus, there are 6 possible values for \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Exponent \\( b \\):**  \n   \\( b \\) can be any even number from 0 to 12. The even numbers in this range are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.  \n   Thus, there are 7 possible values for \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Exponent \\( c \\):**  \n   \\( c \\) can be any even number from 0 to 15. The even numbers in this range are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14.  \n   Thus, there are 8 possible values for \\( c \\).\n\nTo find the total number of perfect square factors, we multiply the number of choices for each exponent:\n\\[\n6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 336\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>336</ANSWER>",

  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided, we need to verify each step of the reasoning and calculations made in determining the number of positive perfect square factors of the product \\( N = (2^{10})(3^{12})(5^{15}) \\).\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Squares**: \n   A perfect square must have all even exponents in its prime factorization. The solution correctly identifies that for \\( N \\), the exponents of the prime factors must be even.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: \n   The prime factorization of \\( N \\) is correctly stated as \\( N = 2^{10} \\times 3^{12} \\times 5^{15} \\).\n\n3. **Finding Possible Values for Exponents**:\n   - For \\( a \\) (the exponent of 2): The even numbers from 0 to 10 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. This gives us 6 options, which is correct.\n   - For \\( b \\) (the exponent of 3): The even numbers from 0 to 12 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. This gives us 7 options, which is also correct.\n   - For \\( c \\) (the exponent of 5): The even numbers from 0 to 15 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. This gives us 8 options, which is correct as well.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Perfect Square Factors**:\n   The total number of perfect square factors is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each exponent:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 336\n   \\]\n   This calculation is accurate.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: \n   The solution concludes that the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of \\( N \\) is \\( \\boxed{336} \\), which matches the calculated result.\n\nSince all steps are correctly reasoned and calculated, the solution is indeed correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
