  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many segments Stuart will draw before returning to his starting point \\( A \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two concentric circles: a smaller one and a larger one.\n   - Chords of the larger circle are drawn such that each chord is tangent to the smaller circle.\n   - The angle \\( m\\angle ABC = 75^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Geometry:**\n   - The chords \\( \\overline{AB}, \\overline{BC}, \\ldots \\) form a sequence of equal angles at the center of the circle.\n   - Since each chord is tangent to the smaller circle, the angle subtended by each chord at the center of the larger circle is twice the angle \\( m\\angle ABC \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Central Angle:**\n   - The angle subtended by each chord at the center of the larger circle is \\( 2 \\times 75^\\circ = 150^\\circ \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Number of Chords:**\n   - The total angle around a point (the center of the circle) is \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n   - To find the number of chords, we divide the total angle by the angle subtended by each chord:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{150^\\circ} = \\frac{360}{150} = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4\n   \\]\n   - Since \\( 2.4 \\) is not an integer, it indicates that the chords will not complete a full circle with an integer number of segments.\n\n5. **Finding the Least Common Multiple:**\n   - To return to the starting point \\( A \\), the total angle must be a multiple of \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n   - The least common multiple of \\( 360^\\circ \\) and \\( 150^\\circ \\) is \\( 1800^\\circ \\).\n   - Therefore, the number of segments required is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1800^\\circ}{150^\\circ} = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Stuart will draw \\(\\boxed{12}\\) segments before returning to his starting point at \\( A \\).\n\n<ANSWER>12</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps necessary to determine how many segments Stuart will draw before returning to his starting point at \\( A \\). Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: The solution correctly identifies that the chords are tangent to the smaller circle and that the angle \\( m\\angle ABC = 75^\\circ \\) is the angle between two consecutive chords.\n\n2. **Calculating the Central Angle**: The solution accurately calculates the central angle subtended by each chord as \\( 2 \\times 75^\\circ = 150^\\circ \\). This is a crucial step because it establishes how much of the circle is covered by each segment.\n\n3. **Determining the Number of Chords**: The solution correctly divides the total angle around a point (360 degrees) by the angle subtended by each chord (150 degrees):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{150^\\circ} = 2.4\n   \\]\n   This indicates that the chords will not complete a full circle with an integer number of segments, which is an important observation.\n\n4. **Finding the Least Common Multiple**: The solution then correctly identifies that to return to point \\( A \\), the total angle must be a multiple of \\( 360^\\circ \\). The least common multiple of \\( 360^\\circ \\) and \\( 150^\\circ \\) is calculated as \\( 1800^\\circ \\). This step is crucial because it ensures that the total angle covered by the segments will eventually lead back to the starting point.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: The solution concludes by calculating the number of segments required to reach \\( 1800^\\circ \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1800^\\circ}{150^\\circ} = 12\n   \\]\n   This final step is correct and leads to the conclusion that Stuart will draw 12 segments before returning to point \\( A \\).\n\nOverall, each step in the solution is logically sound and mathematically accurate. The final answer of 12 segments is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
