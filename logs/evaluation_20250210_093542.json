  "solution": "To solve the integral \n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 3}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx,\n\\]\n\nwe can use the method of partial fractions or direct integration if the denominator can be factored or simplified.\n\nFirst, we notice that the denominator \\(x^2 + 4x + 5\\) can be rewritten by completing the square:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x + 5 = (x^2 + 4x + 4) + 1 = (x + 2)^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 3}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\nNext, we can split the numerator \\(2x + 3\\) in a way that makes it easier to integrate. We can express \\(2x + 3\\) as:\n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 2(x + 2) + 1.\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting this back into the integral gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2(x + 2) + 1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\int \\frac{2(x + 2)}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx + \\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\nThe first integral can be solved using the substitution \\(u = (x + 2)^2 + 1\\), which leads to:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2(x + 2)}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1).\n\\]\n\nThe second integral is a standard integral that results in:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\tan^{-1}(x + 2).\n\\]\n\nCombining these results, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 3}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx = \\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1) + \\tan^{-1}(x + 2).\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>ln((x + 2)**2 + 1) + atan(x + 2)</answer>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, let's go through the steps outlined in the solution and verify each part.\n\n1. **Integral Setup**: The integral given is \n\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{2x + 3}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx.\n   \\]\n\n   This is correctly stated.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**: The denominator \\(x^2 + 4x + 5\\) is rewritten as \n\n   \\[\n   (x + 2)^2 + 1.\n   \\]\n\n   This step is correct, as completing the square is done properly.\n\n3. **Rewriting the Numerator**: The numerator \\(2x + 3\\) is expressed as \n\n   \\[\n   2(x + 2) + 1.\n   \\]\n\n   This is also correct, as it simplifies the integration process.\n\n4. **Splitting the Integral**: The integral is split into two parts:\n\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{2(x + 2)}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx + \\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx.\n   \\]\n\n   This is a valid approach and correctly follows from the previous step.\n\n5. **First Integral Calculation**: The first integral \n\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{2(x + 2)}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n   is solved using the substitution \\(u = (x + 2)^2 + 1\\). However, the solution provided states that it results in \n\n   \\[\n   \\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1).\n   \\]\n\n   This is incorrect. The correct evaluation should yield:\n\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{2(x + 2)}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx = \\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1) + C,\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(C\\) is a constant of integration. The derivative of \\(\\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1)\\) does not yield the integrand correctly.\n\n6. **Second Integral Calculation**: The second integral \n\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n   is correctly identified as \n\n   \\[\n   \\tan^{-1}(x + 2).\n   \\]\n\n7. **Combining Results**: The final expression given is \n\n   \\[\n   \\ln((x + 2)^2 + 1) + \\tan^{-1}(x + 2).\n   \\]\n\n   However, since the first integral was incorrectly evaluated, the final answer is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the steps leading up to the final answer were mostly correct, the evaluation of the first integral was flawed, leading to an incorrect final result. Therefore, the solution does not correctly answer the question.\n\n<MARK>0</MARK>",
