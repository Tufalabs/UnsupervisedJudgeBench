  "question": "The probability of getting rain on any given day in June in Capital City is $\\frac{1}{10}$.  What is the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June, given that the probability of rain on any given day is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). June has 30 days, so we can model this situation using a binomial distribution where:\n\n- \\( n = 30 \\) (the number of trials, or days in June),\n- \\( p = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\) (the probability of rain on any given day),\n- \\( X \\) is the random variable representing the number of days it rains in June.\n\nWe are interested in finding \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\), which is the probability that it rains on at most 2 days. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\\]\n\nThe probability of exactly \\( k \\) days of rain is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities:\n\n1. **Probability of 0 days of rain (\\( P(X = 0) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 0) = \\binom{30}{0} (0.1)^0 (0.9)^{30} = 1 \\times 1 \\times (0.9)^{30}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{30}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{30} \\approx 0.042391\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 0) \\approx 0.042391 \\).\n\n2. **Probability of 1 day of rain (\\( P(X = 1) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{30}{1} (0.1)^1 (0.9)^{29} = 30 \\times 0.1 \\times (0.9)^{29}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{29}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{29} \\approx 0.047709\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 1) = 30 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.047709 \\approx 0.143127 \\).\n\n3. **Probability of 2 days of rain (\\( P(X = 2) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{30}{2} (0.1)^2 (0.9)^{28} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} \\times 0.01 \\times (0.9)^{28}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{28}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{28} \\approx 0.053010\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 2) = 435 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.053010 \\approx 0.230128 \\).\n\nNow, sum these probabilities to find \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \\approx 0.042391 + 0.143127 + 0.230128 = 0.415646\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest thousandth, the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.416}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>0.416</ANSWER>",

The final rounding is also done correctly.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
