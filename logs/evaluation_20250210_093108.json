  "question": "integrate(sin(x)**2*cos(x), x)",
  "solution": "To solve the integral of sin(x)**2*cos(x), we can use a substitution method. \n\nLet:\nu = sin(x)\nThen, the derivative of u with respect to x is:\ndu/dx = cos(x) \nor \ndu = cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\nThe integral becomes:\n∫ sin(x)**2 * cos(x) dx = ∫ u**2 du\n\nNow we can integrate u**2:\n∫ u**2 du = (1/3) * u**3 + C\n\nSubstituting back for u:\n= (1/3) * (sin(x))**3 + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<answer>(1/3)*sin(x)**3</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps for integrating the function \\( \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) \\) using substitution. Let's break down the steps to verify their correctness:\n\n1. **Substitution**: The substitution \\( u = \\sin(x) \\) is appropriate because it simplifies the integral. The derivative \\( du/dx = \\cos(x) \\) is also correctly identified, leading to \\( du = \\cos(x) dx \\).\n\n2. **Rewriting the Integral**: The integral \\( \\int \\sin(x)^2 \\cos(x) dx \\) is correctly rewritten as \\( \\int u^2 du \\) after substituting \\( u \\) and \\( du \\).\n\n3. **Integration**: The integral \\( \\int u^2 du \\) is correctly computed as \\( \\frac{1}{3} u^3 + C \\).\n\n4. **Back Substitution**: The back substitution step is also correctly executed, where \\( u \\) is replaced back with \\( \\sin(x) \\), resulting in \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\sin(x)^3 + C \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The final answer is presented as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\sin(x)^3 + C \\), which is consistent with the integration performed.\n\nOverall, each step in the solution is logically sound and correctly executed. The integration process, substitution, and back substitution are all performed accurately.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
