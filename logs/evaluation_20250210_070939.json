  "question": "The probability of getting rain on any given day in June in Capital City is $\\frac{1}{10}$.  What is the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June, given that the probability of rain on any given day is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). June has 30 days, so we can model this situation using a binomial distribution where:\n\n- \\( n = 30 \\) (the number of trials, or days in June),\n- \\( p = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\) (the probability of rain on any given day),\n- \\( X \\) is the random variable representing the number of days it rains in June.\n\nWe are interested in finding \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\), which is the probability that it rains on at most 2 days. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\\]\n\nThe probability of exactly \\( k \\) days of rain is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities:\n\n1. **Probability of 0 days of rain (\\( P(X = 0) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 0) = \\binom{30}{0} (0.1)^0 (0.9)^{30} = 1 \\times 1 \\times (0.9)^{30}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{30}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{30} \\approx 0.042391\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 0) \\approx 0.042391 \\).\n\n2. **Probability of 1 day of rain (\\( P(X = 1) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{30}{1} (0.1)^1 (0.9)^{29} = 30 \\times 0.1 \\times (0.9)^{29}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{29}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{29} \\approx 0.047709\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 1) = 30 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.047709 \\approx 0.143127 \\).\n\n3. **Probability of 2 days of rain (\\( P(X = 2) \\)):**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{30}{2} (0.1)^2 (0.9)^{28} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} \\times 0.01 \\times (0.9)^{28}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\((0.9)^{28}\\):\n\n\\[\n(0.9)^{28} \\approx 0.053010\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(X = 2) = 435 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.053010 \\approx 0.230128 \\).\n\nNow, sum these probabilities to find \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \\approx 0.042391 + 0.143127 + 0.230128 = 0.415646\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest thousandth, the probability that it rains on at most 2 days in June is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.416}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>0.416</ANSWER>",

  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps necessary to calculate the probability of it raining on at most 2 days in June using the binomial distribution. Let's break down the evaluation of the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Binomial Distribution**: The solution correctly identifies that the situation can be modeled using a binomial distribution with parameters \\( n = 30 \\) (days in June) and \\( p = 0.1 \\) (probability of rain on any given day).\n\n2. **Calculating \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\)**: The solution correctly states that to find \\( P(X \\leq 2) \\), we need to calculate \\( P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\( P(X = 0) \\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\( P(X = 0) \\) is correct:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 0) = (0.9)^{30} \\approx 0.042391\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\( P(X = 1) \\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\( P(X = 1) \\) is also correct:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 1) = 30 \\times 0.1 \\times (0.9)^{29} \\approx 0.143127\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating \\( P(X = 2) \\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\( P(X = 2) \\) is correct:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 2) = 435 \\times 0.01 \\times (0.9)^{28} \\approx 0.230128\n     \\]\n\n6. **Summing the Probabilities**:\n   - The sum of the probabilities is calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     P(X \\leq 2) \\approx 0.042391 + 0.143127 + 0.230128 = 0.415646\n     \\]\n\n7. **Rounding**: The final step of rounding \\( 0.415646 \\) to the nearest thousandth is done correctly, resulting in \\( 0.416 \\).\n\nOverall, each step of the solution is accurate, and the final answer is correctly rounded and presented. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
