  "question": "integrate(cosh(2*x), x)",
  "solution": "To solve the integral of cosh(2*x) with respect to x, we can use the fact that the integral of cosh(k*x) is (1/k) * sinh(k*x). \n\nHere, k = 2. Therefore, we have:\n\nâˆ« cosh(2*x) dx = (1/2) * sinh(2*x)\n\nNow, we can express this in Python sympy format:\n\nintegrate(cosh(2*x), x) = (1/2) * sinh(2*x)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>(1/2) * sinh(2*x)</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze the steps taken to integrate the function \\( \\cosh(2x) \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral**: The integral of \\( \\cosh(kx) \\) is known to be \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\sinh(kx) + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. In this case, \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Formula**: The solution correctly identifies \\( k = 2 \\) and applies the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\cosh(2x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\sinh(2x) + C\n   \\]\n   The solution omits the constant of integration \\( C \\), which is typically included in indefinite integrals. However, the main part of the solution is still correct.\n\n3. **Final Expression**: The solution states:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\cosh(2x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\sinh(2x)\n   \\]\n   This is indeed correct, but it should ideally include the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Python Sympy Format**: The solution also provides the expression in a Python sympy format, which is appropriate and correctly formatted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the main computation is correct, the omission of the constant of integration is a minor oversight. However, since the core integral is evaluated correctly, I will mark the solution as correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
