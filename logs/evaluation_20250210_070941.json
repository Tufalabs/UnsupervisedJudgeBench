  "question": "Let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $ABC.$  For all points $P$ on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC,$\n\\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2\\]is a constant.  Express this constant in terms of the side lengths $a,$ $b,$ $c$ and circumradius $R$ of triangle $ABC.$",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression \\( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 \\) for a point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\n\nThe orthocenter \\( H \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) is the point where the altitudes intersect. For any point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle, the power of point \\( P \\) with respect to the circumcircle is zero, i.e., \\( PA \\cdot PA' = PB \\cdot PB' = PC \\cdot PC' = 0 \\), where \\( A', B', C' \\) are the antipodal points of \\( A, B, C \\) respectively.\n\n### Step 2: Use of Known Results\n\nA known result in geometry states that for any point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle of triangle \\( ABC \\), the following holds:\n\\[\nPA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = 4R^2 + OP^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( O \\) is the circumcenter of triangle \\( ABC \\) and \\( R \\) is the circumradius.\n\n### Step 3: Express \\( PH^2 \\)\n\nThe distance from the orthocenter \\( H \\) to any point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle can be expressed using the relation:\n\\[\nPH^2 = 4R^2 - OP^2\n\\]\nThis is derived from the fact that \\( H \\) and \\( O \\) are isogonal conjugates with respect to the circumcircle.\n\n### Step 4: Substitute and Simplify\n\nSubstitute the expressions for \\( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 \\) and \\( PH^2 \\) into the given expression:\n\\[\nPA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 = (4R^2 + OP^2) - (4R^2 - OP^2)\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[\nPA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 = 2OP^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Constant\n\nSince \\( P \\) is on the circumcircle, \\( OP = R \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n2OP^2 = 2R^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression \\( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 \\) is a constant equal to \\( 2R^2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe constant is expressed in terms of the circumradius \\( R \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2R^2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>2R^2</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly addresses the problem by analyzing the expression \\( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 \\) for a point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle of triangle \\( ABC \\). Let's break down the reasoning step by step to confirm its correctness.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: The solution correctly identifies the orthocenter \\( H \\) and the circumcircle properties. It mentions the power of point \\( P \\) being zero, which is relevant but not directly used in the final calculations.\n\n2. **Known Result**: The solution correctly states the known result that for any point \\( P \\) on the circumcircle:\n   \\[\n   PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 = 4R^2 + OP^2\n   \\]\n   This is a well-established result in triangle geometry.\n\n3. **Expression for \\( PH^2 \\)**: The solution provides the correct expression for \\( PH^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   PH^2 = 4R^2 - OP^2\n   \\]\n   This is also a known result, as \\( H \\) and \\( O \\) (the circumcenter) are related in this manner.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification**: The substitution of the expressions for \\( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 \\) and \\( PH^2 \\) into the original expression is done correctly:\n   \\[\n   PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 = (4R^2 + OP^2) - (4R^2 - OP^2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this yields:\n   \\[\n   PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 - PH^2 = 2OP^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluating the Constant**: The solution correctly identifies that since \\( P \\) is on the circumcircle, \\( OP = R \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   2OP^2 = 2R^2\n   \\]\n   This leads to the conclusion that the expression is indeed a constant equal to \\( 2R^2 \\).\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The final boxed answer \\( \\boxed{2R^2} \\) is correct and matches the derived constant.\n\nOverall, the solution follows a logical progression, uses correct geometric properties, and arrives at the correct conclusion. Therefore, I conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
