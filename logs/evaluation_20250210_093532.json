  "question": "integrate(acosh(x)/x, x)",
  "solution": "Only definite integrals are supported",
  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The solution provided states, \"Only definite integrals are supported.\" This response does not address the question of integrating the function \\(\\frac{\\text{acosh}(x)}{x}\\) with respect to \\(x\\). \n\nThe original question asks for the indefinite integral of the function, which is a valid request in calculus. The solution fails to provide any information or steps related to the integration process, nor does it acknowledge the possibility of finding an indefinite integral. \n\nSince the response does not attempt to solve the integral or provide any relevant information about the integration of the given function, it is incorrect. \n\nThus, the final verdict is:\n<MARK>0</MARK> \n\nThe reasoning is based on the fact that the solution does not engage with the problem at all and simply states a limitation that is not applicable to the question asked.",
