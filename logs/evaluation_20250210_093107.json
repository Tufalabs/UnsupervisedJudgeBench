  "question": "integrate(exp(-x**2), x)",
  "solution": "To solve the integral of the function exp(-x**2) with respect to x, we recognize that this integral does not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. However, it is commonly expressed in terms of the error function, which is defined as:\n\nerf(x) = (2/sqrt(pi)) * integral(exp(-t**2), t, 0, x)\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of exp(-x**2) can be expressed in terms of the error function as follows:\n\nintegral(exp(-x**2), x) = (sqrt(pi)/2) * erf(x) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we will express the result without the constant of integration:\n\n<answer>(sqrt(pi)/2) * erf(x)</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly identifies that the integral of \\( \\exp(-x^2) \\) does not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Instead, it is expressed in terms of the error function, which is a well-known special function used to represent this integral.\n\nThe error function is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^x \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt\n\\]\n\nThe solution then correctly states that the indefinite integral of \\( \\exp(-x^2) \\) can be expressed in terms of the error function as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\exp(-x^2) \\, dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(x) + C\n\\]\n\nThis is indeed the correct expression for the indefinite integral of \\( \\exp(-x^2) \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. The solution also correctly notes that the result can be expressed without the constant of integration, leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\exp(-x^2) \\, dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\text{erf}(x)\n\\]\n\nThus, the solution is accurate in its explanation and derivation of the integral.\n\nFinal verdict:\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
