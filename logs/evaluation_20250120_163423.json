  "question": "How many even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits?\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding how many even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits, we can break it down into several steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Range\nWe are looking for numbers between 4000 and 7000. This means the thousands digit can be 4, 5, or 6.\n\n### Step 2: Ensure the Number is Even\nFor a number to be even, its units digit must be one of the even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Each Case for the Thousands Digit\n\n#### Case 1: Thousands Digit is 4\n- The number is of the form 4XXX.\n- The units digit (X) must be even: 0, 2, 6, or 8 (4 is not allowed as it would repeat the thousands digit).\n- Choose the hundreds and tens digits from the remaining digits.\n\n**Sub-case 1.1: Units Digit is 0**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (7 choices).\n- Choose 2 digits from these 7: \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\).\n- Arrange these 2 digits: \\( 2! = 2 \\).\n- Total for this sub-case: \\( 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 1.2: Units Digit is 2**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (7 choices).\n- Total: \\( 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 1.3: Units Digit is 6**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 (7 choices).\n- Total: \\( 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 1.4: Units Digit is 8**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (7 choices).\n- Total: \\( 21 \\times 2 = 42 \\).\n\nTotal for Case 1: \\( 42 + 42 + 42 + 42 = 168 \\).\n\n#### Case 2: Thousands Digit is 5\n- The number is of the form 5XXX.\n- The units digit (X) must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\n**Sub-case 2.1: Units Digit is 0**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 2.2: Units Digit is 2**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 2.3: Units Digit is 4**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 2.4: Units Digit is 6**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 2.5: Units Digit is 8**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\nTotal for Case 2: \\( 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 280 \\).\n\n#### Case 3: Thousands Digit is 6\n- The number is of the form 6XXX.\n- The units digit (X) must be even: 0, 2, 4, or 8 (6 is not allowed as it would repeat the thousands digit).\n\n**Sub-case 3.1: Units Digit is 0**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 3.2: Units Digit is 2**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 3.3: Units Digit is 4**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\n**Sub-case 3.4: Units Digit is 8**\n- Remaining digits for hundreds and tens: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 (8 choices).\n- Total: \\( 28 \\times 2 = 56 \\).\n\nTotal for Case 3: \\( 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 224 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Totals from All Cases\nAdd the totals from each case to find the total number of even integers with four different digits between 4000 and 7000:\n\n\\[ 168 + 280 + 224 = 672 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of even integers between 4000 and 7000 with four different digits is:\n\n<ANSWER>672</ANSWER>",
