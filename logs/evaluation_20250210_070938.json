  "question": "How many positive three-digit integers less than 500 have at least two digits that are the same?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive three-digit integers less than 500 that have at least two digits that are the same. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Range\nThree-digit integers less than 500 range from 100 to 499.\n\n### Step 2: Total Number of Three-Digit Integers Less Than 500\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 499. Therefore, the total number of three-digit integers less than 500 is:\n\\[ 499 - 100 + 1 = 400. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Count Numbers with All Distinct Digits\nTo find the numbers with at least two digits the same, it might be easier to first count the numbers with all distinct digits and then subtract from the total.\n\n#### Hundreds Digit\nThe hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the number must be less than 500). So, there are 4 choices for the hundreds digit.\n\n#### Tens Digit\nThe tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the digit chosen for the hundreds place. Therefore, there are 9 choices for the tens digit.\n\n#### Units Digit\nThe units digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the digits chosen for the hundreds and tens places. Therefore, there are 8 choices for the units digit.\n\n#### Total with All Distinct Digits\nThe total number of three-digit numbers with all distinct digits is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 288. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Numbers with At Least Two Digits the Same\nNow, subtract the number of numbers with all distinct digits from the total number of three-digit numbers less than 500:\n\\[ 400 - 288 = 112. \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive three-digit integers less than 500 that have at least two digits the same is:\n\n<ANSWER>112</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "Let's evaluate the solution step by step to determine its correctness.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Range\nThe solution correctly identifies that three-digit integers less than 500 range from 100 to 499.\n\n### Step 2: Total Number of Three-Digit Integers Less Than 500\nThe calculation of the total number of three-digit integers less than 500 is correct:\n\\[ 499 - 100 + 1 = 400. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Count Numbers with All Distinct Digits\nThe solution proceeds to count the numbers with all distinct digits, which is a valid approach to find the complement of the desired set (numbers with at least two digits the same).\n\n#### Hundreds Digit\nThe hundreds digit can indeed be 1, 2, 3, or 4, giving 4 choices. This is correct.\n\n#### Tens Digit\nThe tens digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the digit chosen for the hundreds place. Thus, there are 9 choices for the tens digit, which is also correct.\n\n#### Units Digit\nThe units digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the digits chosen for the hundreds and tens places. Therefore, there are 8 choices for the units digit, which is correct.\n\n#### Total with All Distinct Digits\nThe total number of three-digit numbers with all distinct digits is calculated as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 288. \\]\nThis calculation is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Numbers with At Least Two Digits the Same\nThe solution correctly subtracts the number of numbers with all distinct digits from the total number of three-digit numbers less than 500:\n\\[ 400 - 288 = 112. \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final answer provided in the solution is 112, which is indeed the correct count of positive three-digit integers less than 500 that have at least two digits the same.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
