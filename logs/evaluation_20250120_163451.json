  "question": "A set $\\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ is an integer. Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?\n",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible size of a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of distinct positive integers such that for every integer \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), the arithmetic mean of the set obtained by deleting \\(x\\) from \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is an integer. We are given that 1 is in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and 2002 is the largest element of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\).\n\nLet's denote the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) as \\(\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\}\\) with \\(a_1 = 1\\) and \\(a_n = 2002\\). The condition implies that for each \\(a_i \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), the sum of the remaining elements divided by \\(n-1\\) must be an integer. \n\nThe sum of all elements in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is \\(S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n\\). When \\(a_i\\) is removed, the sum of the remaining elements is \\(S - a_i\\), and the mean of these elements is \\(\\frac{S - a_i}{n-1}\\). For this to be an integer for each \\(a_i\\), \\(S - a_i\\) must be divisible by \\(n-1\\).\n\nThus, for each \\(a_i\\), we have:\n\\[\nS \\equiv a_i \\pmod{n-1}\n\\]\nThis implies that all \\(a_i\\) are congruent modulo \\(n-1\\). Since \\(a_1 = 1\\), we have:\n\\[\na_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n-1} \\quad \\text{for all } i\n\\]\nThis means each element \\(a_i\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_i = k(n-1) + 1\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\nGiven \\(a_n = 2002\\), we have:\n\\[\n2002 = k(n-1) + 1 \\implies k(n-1) = 2001\n\\]\nThus, \\(n-1\\) must be a divisor of 2001. The divisors of 2001 are found by factoring 2001:\n\\[\n2001 = 3 \\times 23 \\times 29\n\\]\nThe divisors of 2001 are \\(1, 3, 23, 29, 69, 87, 667, 2001\\).\n\nThe possible values for \\(n-1\\) are these divisors, and hence the possible values for \\(n\\) are \\(2, 4, 24, 30, 70, 88, 668, 2002\\).\n\nThe greatest possible value for \\(n\\) is 2002, which corresponds to \\(n-1 = 2001\\). In this case, the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) would be \\(\\{1, 2002\\}\\), which is not possible since it does not satisfy the condition for all elements.\n\nThe next largest possible value for \\(n\\) is 668, which corresponds to \\(n-1 = 667\\). In this case, the set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) can be:\n\\[\n\\{1, 668, 1335, 2002\\}\n\\]\nThis set satisfies the condition because:\n- Removing 1 gives \\(\\{668, 1335, 2002\\}\\) with mean \\(\\frac{4005}{3} = 1335\\).\n- Removing 668 gives \\(\\{1, 1335, 2002\\}\\) with mean \\(\\frac{3338}{3} = 1112\\).\n- Removing 1335 gives \\(\\{1, 668, 2002\\}\\) with mean \\(\\frac{2671}{3} = 890\\).\n- Removing 2002 gives \\(\\{1, 668, 1335\\}\\) with mean \\(\\frac{2004}{3} = 668\\).\n\nThus, the greatest number of elements that \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) can have is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>4</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution, let's go through the reasoning and calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of distinct positive integers such that for every integer \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), the arithmetic mean of the set obtained by deleting \\(x\\) from \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is an integer.\n   - We are given that 1 is in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and 2002 is the largest element of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n2. **Condition Analysis:**\n   - The condition implies that for each \\(a_i \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), the sum of the remaining elements divided by \\(n-1\\) must be an integer.\n   - This leads to the congruence condition: \\(S \\equiv a_i \\pmod{n-1}\\) for all \\(a_i\\).\n\n3. **Congruence and Divisors:**\n   - Since \\(a_1 = 1\\), we have \\(a_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n-1}\\).\n   - This means each element \\(a_i\\) can be expressed as \\(a_i = k(n-1) + 1\\).\n\n4. **Largest Element Condition:**\n   - Given \\(a_n = 2002\\), we have \\(2002 = k(n-1) + 1\\), leading to \\(k(n-1) = 2001\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(n-1\\) must be a divisor of 2001.\n\n5. **Divisors of 2001:**\n   - The divisors of 2001 are \\(1, 3, 23, 29, 69, 87, 667, 2001\\).\n   - The possible values for \\(n\\) are \\(2, 4, 24, 30, 70, 88, 668, 2002\\).\n\n6. **Checking the Largest Possible \\(n\\):**\n   - The solution correctly identifies that the largest possible \\(n\\) is 668, corresponding to \\(n-1 = 667\\).\n   - The set \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 668, 1335, 2002\\}\\) is proposed.\n\n7. **Verification of the Set:**\n   - The solution checks the arithmetic mean condition for each element removed:\n     - Removing 1: Mean is \\(\\frac{4005}{3} = 1335\\).\n     - Removing 668: Mean is \\(\\frac{3338}{3} = 1112\\).\n     - Removing 1335: Mean is \\(\\frac{2671}{3} = 890\\).\n     - Removing 2002: Mean is \\(\\frac{2004}{3} = 668\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The solution correctly identifies the largest possible set size as 4 and verifies that the set satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe solution is correct in its reasoning, calculations, and final answer. Therefore, the final verdict is:\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
