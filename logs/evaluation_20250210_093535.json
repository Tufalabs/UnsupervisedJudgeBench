  "question": "integrate((2*x+1)/(x**2+x+1), x)",
  "solution": "To solve the integral \n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} \\, dx,\n\\]\n\nwe can use the method of partial fractions or direct integration. First, we can simplify the integrand.\n\n1. **Identify the denominator**: The denominator is \\(x^2 + x + 1\\). We can check if it can be factored, but it does not factor nicely over the reals.\n\n2. **Perform polynomial long division**: Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, we can directly integrate.\n\n3. **Split the integrand**: We can express the numerator \\(2x + 1\\) in a form that relates to the derivative of the denominator. Notice that the derivative of the denominator \\(x^2 + x + 1\\) is \\(2x + 1\\).\n\n4. **Rewrite the integral**: We can rewrite the integral as:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} \\, dx = \\int \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\n5. **Use substitution**: Let \\(u = x^2 + x + 1\\). Then, \\(du = (2x + 1) \\, dx\\).\n\n6. **Change the variable**: The integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\ln|u| + C = \\ln|x^2 + x + 1| + C.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final result of the integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(x^2 + x + 1).\n\\]\n\nNow, we can express this in the required format.\n\n<answer>ln(x**2 + x + 1)</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly addresses the integral \n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{2x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\nLet's evaluate the steps taken in the solution:\n\n1. **Identifying the Denominator**: The solution correctly identifies the denominator \\(x^2 + x + 1\\) and notes that it does not factor nicely over the reals. This is a valid observation.\n\n2. **Polynomial Long Division**: The solution states that since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, we can directly integrate. This is correct, but it is more relevant to note that the numerator is actually the derivative of the denominator, which is the key insight for this integral.\n\n3. **Splitting the Integrand**: The solution correctly observes that the numerator \\(2x + 1\\) is the derivative of the denominator \\(x^2 + x + 1\\). This is a crucial step that allows for a straightforward integration.\n\n4. **Rewriting the Integral**: The integral is rewritten correctly as \n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + x + 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} \\, dx.\n\\]\n\n5. **Substitution**: The substitution \\(u = x^2 + x + 1\\) is correctly applied, and the differential \\(du = (2x + 1) \\, dx\\) is also correctly derived.\n\n6. **Changing the Variable**: The integral is transformed into \n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{du}{u},\n\\]\n\nwhich is a standard integral.\n\n7. **Final Result**: The solution concludes with \n\n\\[\n\\ln|u| + C = \\ln|x^2 + x + 1| + C.\n\\]\n\nHowever, it is important to note that since \\(x^2 + x + 1\\) is always positive for all real \\(x\\), the absolute value can be omitted, leading to the final result being simply \n\n\\[\n\\ln(x^2 + x + 1) + C.\n\\]\n\nThe solution correctly arrives at the integral's result, and the final answer is presented in the required format.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
