  "question": "In convex quadrilateral $ABCD$, $AB=BC=13$, $CD=DA=24$, and $\\angle D=60^\\circ$.  Points $X$ and $Y$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{DA}$ respectively.  Compute $XY^2$ (the square of the length of $XY$).",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the square of the length of the segment \\( XY \\), where \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are the midpoints of \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{DA} \\) respectively in the quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\).\n\nFirst, let's place the quadrilateral in the coordinate plane for convenience. Assume \\( D \\) is at the origin, \\( D = (0, 0) \\). Since \\( DA = 24 \\) and \\( \\angle D = 60^\\circ \\), we can place \\( A \\) at \\( (24, 0) \\).\n\nNext, consider \\( \\triangle DAB \\). Since \\( AB = 13 \\) and \\( DA = 24 \\), and \\( \\angle DAB = 60^\\circ \\), we can use the Law of Cosines in \\( \\triangle DAB \\) to find the coordinates of \\( B \\).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\\[\nAB^2 = DA^2 + DB^2 - 2 \\cdot DA \\cdot DB \\cdot \\cos(\\angle DAB)\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n13^2 = 24^2 + DB^2 - 2 \\cdot 24 \\cdot DB \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n169 = 576 + DB^2 - 24 \\cdot DB\n\\]\n\\[\nDB^2 - 24 \\cdot DB + 576 = 169\n\\]\n\\[\nDB^2 - 24 \\cdot DB + 407 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for \\( DB \\), we use the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nDB = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -24 \\), and \\( c = 407 \\).\n\n\\[\nDB = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{24^2 - 4 \\cdot 407}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nDB = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{576 - 1628}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nDB = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{-1052}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we made a mistake in our setup. Let's try a different approach by using vector geometry.\n\nAssume \\( D = (0, 0) \\) and \\( A = (24, 0) \\). Since \\( \\angle D = 60^\\circ \\), \\( C \\) is at \\( (12, 12\\sqrt{3}) \\) because \\( CD = 24 \\) and \\( \\angle CDA = 60^\\circ \\).\n\nNow, \\( B \\) is at \\( (12, 12\\sqrt{3}) \\) because \\( BC = 13 \\) and \\( AB = 13 \\).\n\nThe coordinates of \\( X \\), the midpoint of \\( BC \\), are:\n\\[\nX = \\left( \\frac{12 + 12}{2}, \\frac{12\\sqrt{3} + 12\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = (12, 12\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nThe coordinates of \\( Y \\), the midpoint of \\( DA \\), are:\n\\[\nY = \\left( \\frac{0 + 24}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (12, 0)\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\( XY^2 \\):\n\\[\nXY^2 = (12 - 12)^2 + (12\\sqrt{3} - 0)^2 = 0 + (12\\sqrt{3})^2 = 432\n\\]\n\nThus, the square of the length of \\( XY \\) is \\(\\boxed{432}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>432</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided, we need to check the steps taken to find the square of the length of segment \\( XY \\) in the convex quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\).\n\n1. **Placement of Points**: The solution correctly places point \\( D \\) at the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) and point \\( A \\) at \\( (24, 0) \\). This is a reasonable choice given the lengths and angles provided.\n\n2. **Finding Coordinates of Points B and C**:\n   - The solution attempts to find the coordinates of point \\( B \\) using the Law of Cosines. However, it seems to have made an error in the setup of the triangle \\( DAB \\). The angle \\( \\angle DAB \\) is not \\( 60^\\circ \\) but rather \\( \\angle D \\) which is \\( 60^\\circ \\). This means the angle used in the Law of Cosines should be adjusted accordingly.\n   - The coordinates of point \\( C \\) are derived from the placement of \\( D \\) and \\( A \\) and the angle \\( \\angle CDA \\). The coordinates of \\( C \\) are correctly calculated as \\( (12, 12\\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\n3. **Midpoints Calculation**:\n   - The midpoint \\( X \\) of \\( BC \\) is calculated as \\( (12, 12\\sqrt{3}) \\). However, the coordinates of \\( B \\) were not correctly established, which raises concerns about the accuracy of \\( X \\).\n   - The midpoint \\( Y \\) of \\( DA \\) is correctly calculated as \\( (12, 0) \\).\n\n4. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - The distance \\( XY^2 \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     XY^2 = (12 - 12)^2 + (12\\sqrt{3} - 0)^2 = 0 + (12\\sqrt{3})^2 = 432\n     \\]\n   - This calculation is correct based on the coordinates provided for \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The final answer of \\( XY^2 = 432 \\) is correct based on the calculations shown. However, the derivation of the coordinates for point \\( B \\) was flawed, which could lead to incorrect placement of point \\( X \\). The solution ultimately arrives at the correct answer, but the reasoning and calculations leading to the coordinates of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) were not entirely accurate.\n\nGiven these observations, while the final answer is correct, the method used to arrive at it contains significant errors. Therefore, I will mark the solution as incorrect.\n\n<MARK>0</MARK>",
