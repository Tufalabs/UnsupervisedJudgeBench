  "solution": "To solve the integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2} \\, dx \\), we can use the fact that the derivative of the hyperbolic tangent function is related to the integrand.\n\nRecall that:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\tanh(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\n\\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2} \\, dx = \\tanh(x) + C\n\\]\n\nSince we are asked to return the answer without the constant of integration, we have:\n\n<answer>tanh(x)</answer>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze the integral and the steps taken to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe integral given is:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe solution states that the derivative of the hyperbolic tangent function is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\tanh(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis is indeed correct. The derivative of \\(\\tanh(x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\\), which means that integrating \\(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\\) will yield \\(\\tanh(x)\\) plus a constant of integration \\(C\\).\n\nThe solution correctly states:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2} \\, dx = \\tanh(x) + C\n\\]\n\nThe final answer provided is:\n\n<answer>tanh(x)</answer>\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the question asks for the integral without the constant of integration. The solution correctly identifies that the integral evaluates to \\(\\tanh(x) + C\\) and then omits the constant \\(C\\) in the final answer, which is appropriate given the instruction.\n\nTo verify the correctness of the solution, we can differentiate the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\tanh(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the original integrand \\(\\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)^2}\\), confirming that the integration was performed correctly.\n\nSince all steps are correct and the final answer is appropriately formatted without the constant of integration, I conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
