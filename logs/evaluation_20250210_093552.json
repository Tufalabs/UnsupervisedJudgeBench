  "question": "integrate(1/(x**2+4*x+5), x)",
  "solution": "To solve the integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx \\), we first need to simplify the integrand.\n\n1. **Complete the square** for the quadratic expression in the denominator:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 4x + 5 = (x^2 + 4x + 4) + 1 = (x + 2)^2 + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite the integral** using the completed square:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the substitution** \\( u = x + 2 \\), which gives \\( du = dx \\). The integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. The integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du \\) is a standard integral that evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\tan^{-1}(u) + C\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting back** for \\( u \\):\n   \\[\n   \\tan^{-1}(x + 2)\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result of the integral is:\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx = \\tan^{-1}(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nNow, wrapping the answer in the required tags:\n\n<answer>atan(x + 2)</answer>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps necessary to evaluate the integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx \\).\n\n1. **Completing the square**: The expression \\( x^2 + 4x + 5 \\) is correctly rewritten as \\( (x + 2)^2 + 1 \\). This step is crucial for simplifying the integral.\n\n2. **Rewriting the integral**: The integral is correctly transformed into \\( \\int \\frac{1}{(x + 2)^2 + 1} \\, dx \\).\n\n3. **Substitution**: The substitution \\( u = x + 2 \\) is correctly applied, and the differential \\( du = dx \\) is also correctly noted. This leads to the integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du \\).\n\n4. **Evaluating the integral**: The integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du \\) is indeed a standard integral, which evaluates to \\( \\tan^{-1}(u) + C \\). This step is correctly executed.\n\n5. **Back substitution**: The final step of substituting back \\( u = x + 2 \\) to get \\( \\tan^{-1}(x + 2) + C \\) is also correctly done.\n\nHowever, there is a minor issue with the final answer formatting. The solution states the final result as:\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 4x + 5} \\, dx = \\tan^{-1}(x + 2)\n\\]\nbut it does not include the constant of integration \\( C \\). The answer wrapped in tags is:\n<answer>atan(x + 2)</answer>\nwhich is not entirely correct because it omits the constant of integration.\n\nDespite this minor oversight, the core steps and calculations leading to the integral's evaluation are correct. Therefore, the solution is fundamentally sound, but it lacks the completeness of including the constant of integration.\n\nFinal verdict:\n<MARK>0</MARK> \n\nThe solution is mostly correct but incomplete due to the omission of the constant of integration \\( C \\).",
