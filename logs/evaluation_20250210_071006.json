  "question": "Three cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a 4, the second card is a $\\clubsuit$, and the third card is a 2?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of a specific sequence of events when drawing three cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. The events are:\n\n1. The first card drawn is a 4.\n2. The second card drawn is a club ($\\clubsuit$).\n3. The third card drawn is a 2.\n\nLet's calculate the probability step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Probability that the first card is a 4.**\n\nThere are 4 fours in a standard deck (4 of hearts, 4 of diamonds, 4 of clubs, and 4 of spades). The probability of drawing a 4 as the first card is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{First card is a 4}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Probability that the second card is a club.**\n\nAfter drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. We need to consider two cases:\n\n- Case 1: The first card was a 4 of clubs. In this case, there are 12 clubs left in the deck.\n- Case 2: The first card was not a 4 of clubs. In this case, there are 13 clubs left in the deck.\n\nThe probability of drawing a club as the second card is a weighted average of these two cases:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Second card is a club}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{12}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- Probability of first card being 4 of clubs and second card being a club:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{12}{51} = \\frac{12}{2652}\n  \\]\n\n- Probability of first card being any other 4 and second card being a club:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{39}{2652}\n  \\]\n\nAdding these probabilities gives:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Second card is a club}) = \\frac{12}{2652} + \\frac{39}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{1}{52}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Probability that the third card is a 2.**\n\nAfter drawing the first two cards, there are 50 cards left in the deck. We need to consider the number of 2s remaining:\n\n- If the first card was a 4 and the second card was a club, none of these affect the number of 2s, so there are still 4 twos in the deck.\n\nThe probability of drawing a 2 as the third card is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Third card is a 2}) = \\frac{4}{50} = \\frac{2}{25}\n\\]\n\n**Final Probability:**\n\nThe overall probability of this sequence of events is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{First card is a 4, second card is a club, third card is a 2}) = \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{25}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this product:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{25} = \\frac{2}{1300} = \\frac{1}{650}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the first card is a 4, the second card is a club, and the third card is a 2 is:\n\n<ANSWER>\\frac{1}{650}</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided, we will go through each step and check for correctness.\n\n**Step 1: Probability that the first card is a 4.**\n- The solution correctly identifies that there are 4 fours in a standard deck of 52 cards. Thus, the probability is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{First card is a 4}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}\n  \\]\nThis step is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Probability that the second card is a club.**\n- The solution considers two cases based on whether the first card drawn was the 4 of clubs or not. This is a necessary consideration because it affects the number of clubs remaining in the deck.\n- The calculations for both cases are as follows:\n  - Case 1: If the first card is the 4 of clubs, there are 12 clubs left. The probability of this happening is:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{12}{51}\n    \\]\n  - Case 2: If the first card is any other 4 (3 possibilities), there are still 13 clubs left. The probability of this happening is:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51}\n    \\]\n- The solution correctly adds these two probabilities:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Second card is a club}) = \\frac{12}{2652} + \\frac{39}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{1}{52}\n  \\]\nThis step is also correct.\n\n**Step 3: Probability that the third card is a 2.**\n- The solution states that after drawing the first two cards, there are 50 cards left. It correctly notes that the number of 2s remaining is unaffected by the first two draws, so there are still 4 twos in the deck. Thus, the probability is:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Third card is a 2}) = \\frac{4}{50} = \\frac{2}{25}\n  \\]\nThis step is correct as well.\n\n**Final Probability Calculation:**\n- The overall probability is calculated as the product of the individual probabilities:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{First card is a 4, second card is a club, third card is a 2}) = \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{25}\n  \\]\nHowever, there is a mistake in the multiplication. The second card's probability was incorrectly stated as \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) instead of \\(\\frac{1}{52}\\). The correct multiplication should be:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{2}{25}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n= \\frac{1 \\times 1 \\times 2}{13 \\times 52 \\times 25} = \\frac{2}{16900}\n\\]\nThis is different from the final answer given in the solution, which was \\(\\frac{1}{650}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe solution contains a critical error in the final multiplication step, leading to an incorrect final probability. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.\n\n<MARK>0</MARK>",
