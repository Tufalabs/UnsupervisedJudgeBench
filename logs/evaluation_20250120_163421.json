  "question": "What is the range of the function $$r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To find the range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\), we need to determine the set of all possible output values (i.e., \\( r(x) \\)) as \\( x \\) varies over its domain.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Domain\nThe function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is undefined when the denominator is zero. Therefore, we solve:\n\\[\n(1-x)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n1-x = 0 \\implies x = 1\n\\]\nThus, the function is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\). The domain of \\( r(x) \\) is all real numbers except \\( x = 1 \\), i.e., \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{1\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Function\nThe expression \\( (1-x)^2 \\) is always positive for \\( x \\neq 1 \\) because it is a square of a real number. Therefore, the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is always positive for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Range\nSince \\( (1-x)^2 > 0 \\) for \\( x \\neq 1 \\), the reciprocal \\( \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is also positive. We need to find the minimum and maximum values of \\( r(x) \\).\n\n- As \\( x \\) approaches 1 from either side, \\( (1-x)^2 \\) approaches 0, causing \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) to approach infinity. Thus, there is no upper bound for \\( r(x) \\).\n\n- As \\( x \\) moves away from 1, \\( (1-x)^2 \\) increases, causing \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) to decrease. The smallest value \\( r(x) \\) can approach is 0, but it never actually reaches 0 because \\( (1-x)^2 \\) is never infinite.\n\nTherefore, the range of \\( r(x) \\) is all positive real numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>(0, \\infty)</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided for determining the range of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is correct. Let's evaluate each step:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Domain\n- The solution correctly identifies that the function is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when \\( (1-x)^2 = 0 \\).\n- Solving \\( 1-x = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 1 \\), so the function is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- The domain is correctly stated as all real numbers except \\( x = 1 \\), i.e., \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{1\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Function\n- The solution correctly notes that \\( (1-x)^2 \\) is always positive for \\( x \\neq 1 \\) because it is a square of a real number.\n- Consequently, \\( r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) is always positive for all \\( x \\neq 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Range\n- The solution correctly analyzes the behavior of \\( r(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 1 from either side, noting that \\( r(x) \\) approaches infinity, indicating no upper bound.\n- It also correctly states that as \\( x \\) moves away from 1, \\( (1-x)^2 \\) increases, causing \\( r(x) \\) to decrease, approaching 0 but never reaching it.\n- Therefore, the range is correctly identified as all positive real numbers, \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n- The final answer is correctly stated as \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThe solution follows a logical sequence, correctly identifies the domain, analyzes the function's behavior, and accurately determines the range. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
