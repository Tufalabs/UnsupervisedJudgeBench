  "question": "In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 3$, $BC = 4$, $AC = 5$, and $BD$ is the angle bisector from vertex $B$.  If $BD = k \\sqrt{2}$, then find $k$.",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the Angle Bisector Theorem and the formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle.\n\nFirst, let's verify that triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle. We have the side lengths \\(AB = 3\\), \\(BC = 4\\), and \\(AC = 5\\). We check if these satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 + BC^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = AC^2\n\\]\n\nSince the equation holds, triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \\(B\\).\n\nNext, we apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, in triangle \\(ABC\\), the angle bisector \\(BD\\) divides \\(AC\\) into segments \\(AD\\) and \\(DC\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nLet \\(AD = 3x\\) and \\(DC = 4x\\). Since \\(AD + DC = AC = 5\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n3x + 4x = 5 \\implies 7x = 5 \\implies x = \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the segments are \\(AD = 3x = \\frac{15}{7}\\) and \\(DC = 4x = \\frac{20}{7}\\).\n\nNow, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \\(BD\\) in a triangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{AB \\cdot BC \\left(1 - \\frac{AC^2}{(AB + BC)^2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 4 \\left(1 - \\frac{5^2}{(3 + 4)^2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{12 \\left(1 - \\frac{25}{49}\\right)} = \\sqrt{12 \\left(\\frac{49 - 25}{49}\\right)} = \\sqrt{12 \\cdot \\frac{24}{49}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{\\frac{288}{49}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{288}}{7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{144 \\cdot 2}}{7} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}\n\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(BD = k\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, equating the expressions for \\(BD\\):\n\n\\[\nk\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{12}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{12}{7}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{12}{7}\\)</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps necessary to find the length of the angle bisector \\(BD\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) and ultimately determines the value of \\(k\\).\n\n1. **Verification of Triangle Type**: The solution correctly identifies triangle \\(ABC\\) as a right triangle by checking the Pythagorean theorem. The calculations confirm that \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\), which is accurate.\n\n2. **Application of the Angle Bisector Theorem**: The solution correctly applies the Angle Bisector Theorem, establishing the ratio of the segments \\(AD\\) and \\(DC\\) as \\(3:4\\). The expressions for \\(AD\\) and \\(DC\\) are correctly set up as \\(AD = 3x\\) and \\(DC = 4x\\), leading to the correct calculation of \\(x\\) and the lengths of \\(AD\\) and \\(DC\\).\n\n3. **Formula for Angle Bisector Length**: The formula used for the length of the angle bisector \\(BD\\) is correct. The substitution of the side lengths into the formula is accurate, and the calculations that follow are also correct. The simplification of the expression inside the square root is done properly, leading to the correct value of \\(BD\\).\n\n4. **Final Calculation of \\(k\\)**: The solution correctly equates \\(BD\\) to \\(k\\sqrt{2}\\) and solves for \\(k\\). The final value of \\(k\\) is derived correctly as \\(\\frac{12}{7}\\).\n\nOverall, each step in the solution is logically sound, and the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
