  "question": "Ramanujan and Hardy played a game where they both picked a complex number. If the product of their numbers was $32-8i$, and Hardy picked $5+3i$, what number did Ramanujan pick?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the complex number that Ramanujan picked, given that the product of the two complex numbers is \\(32 - 8i\\) and Hardy picked \\(5 + 3i\\).\n\nLet's denote the complex number Ramanujan picked as \\(z\\). According to the problem, the product of the two numbers is:\n\n\\[\nz \\cdot (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(z\\), we need to divide \\(32 - 8i\\) by \\(5 + 3i\\). The division of complex numbers involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\nThe conjugate of \\(5 + 3i\\) is \\(5 - 3i\\). Therefore, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(5 - 3i\\):\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i} \\cdot \\frac{5 - 3i}{5 - 3i}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 5^2 - (3i)^2 = 25 - 9(-1) = 25 + 9 = 34\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \\cdot 5 + 32 \\cdot (-3i) - 8i \\cdot 5 - 8i \\cdot (-3i)\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n- \\(32 \\cdot 5 = 160\\)\n- \\(32 \\cdot (-3i) = -96i\\)\n- \\(-8i \\cdot 5 = -40i\\)\n- \\(-8i \\cdot (-3i) = 24i^2 = 24(-1) = -24\\)\n\nCombine these results:\n\n\\[\n160 - 96i - 40i - 24 = 160 - 136i - 24 = 136 - 136i\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the result by the denominator:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34}\n\\]\n\nSeparate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{136}{34} - \\frac{136i}{34} = 4 - 4i\n\\]\n\nThus, the complex number that Ramanujan picked is:\n\n<ANSWER>4 - 4i</ANSWER>",

  "explanation": "To determine if the solution is correct, let's evaluate each step of the provided solution:\n\n1. **Problem Setup:**\n   - The problem states that the product of two complex numbers is \\(32 - 8i\\), and Hardy picked \\(5 + 3i\\). We need to find the complex number \\(z\\) that Ramanujan picked.\n   - The equation is set up correctly as \\(z \\cdot (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i\\).\n\n2. **Division of Complex Numbers:**\n   - To find \\(z\\), the solution correctly states that we need to divide \\(32 - 8i\\) by \\(5 + 3i\\).\n   - The solution correctly uses the conjugate of the denominator, \\(5 - 3i\\), to perform the division.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is calculated as \\((5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 25 + 9 = 34\\). This is correct.\n\n4. **Calculation of the Numerator:**\n   - The numerator is calculated as \\((32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)\\).\n   - The individual terms are calculated as follows:\n     - \\(32 \\cdot 5 = 160\\)\n     - \\(32 \\cdot (-3i) = -96i\\)\n     - \\(-8i \\cdot 5 = -40i\\)\n     - \\(-8i \\cdot (-3i) = 24i^2 = -24\\)\n   - Combining these results gives \\(160 - 96i - 40i - 24 = 136 - 136i\\). This is correct.\n\n5. **Division to Find \\(z\\):**\n   - The solution divides the result by the denominator: \\(\\frac{136 - 136i}{34}\\).\n   - Separating the real and imaginary parts gives:\n     - \\(\\frac{136}{34} = 4\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{-136i}{34} = -4i\\)\n   - Thus, \\(z = 4 - 4i\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The solution concludes that the complex number Ramanujan picked is \\(4 - 4i\\).\n\nEach step of the solution is correct, and the calculations are accurate. The solution correctly finds the complex number that Ramanujan picked.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>\n\nThe solution is correct, and the reasoning and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.",
