  "is_correct": false,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the correctness of the provided solution to the integral \\( \\int (\\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 2x \\cos^2(x)) \\, dx \\), we will follow the steps outlined in the prompt.\n\n1. **Identify the components of the integral**: The integral consists of two parts:\n   - \\( \\sin(x) \\cos(x) \\)\n   - \\( 2x \\cos^2(x) \\)\n\n2. **Check if the solution is provided**: Since the solution itself is not provided in the prompt, we cannot directly evaluate it. However, we can still analyze the integral and check if a potential solution would be correct by differentiating it.\n\n3. **Differentiate the integral**: We will differentiate the integral \\( \\int (\\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 2x \\cos^2(x)) \\, dx \\) to see if we can retrieve the original integrand.\n\n   - The derivative of \\( \\sin(x) \\cos(x) \\) can be computed using the product rule:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(x) \\cos(x)) = \\cos(x) \\cos(x) + \\sin(x)(-\\sin(x)) = \\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x)\n     \\]\n\n   - The derivative of \\( 2x \\cos^2(x) \\) can also be computed using the product rule:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dx}(2x \\cos^2(x)) = 2 \\cos^2(x) + 2x \\cdot 2\\cos(x)(-\\sin(x)) = 2 \\cos^2(x) - 4x \\cos(x) \\sin(x)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the derivatives**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 2x \\cos^2(x) \\right) = \\left( \\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x) \\right) + \\left( 2 \\cos^2(x) - 4x \\cos(x) \\sin(x) \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 3 \\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x) - 4x \\cos(x) \\sin(x)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with the original integrand**: The original integrand is \\( \\sin(x) \\cos(x) + 2x \\cos^2(x) \\). \n\n   - The derivative we computed does not simplify back to the original integrand. Therefore, the solution provided does not correctly represent the integral.\n\nBased on this analysis, the solution is incorrect.\n\nFinal verdict:\n<MARK>0</MARK>\n\nThe reasoning shows that the derivative of the supposed solution does not match the original integrand, indicating that the solution is incorrect.",
