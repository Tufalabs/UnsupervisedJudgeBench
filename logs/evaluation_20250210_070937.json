  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region between the two concentric circles and then determine the radius of a third circle that has the same area as this shaded region.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of the larger circle.**\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nFor the larger circle with radius 29 units:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{large}} = \\pi \\times 29^2 = \\pi \\times 841 = 841\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the area of the smaller circle.**\n\nFor the smaller circle with radius 19 units:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{small}} = \\pi \\times 19^2 = \\pi \\times 361 = 361\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the area of the shaded region.**\n\nThe shaded region is the area between the two circles, which is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the radius of the third circle with the same area as the shaded region.**\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the radius of the third circle. The area of this circle is also \\( 480\\pi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 480\\pi\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 480\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{480}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{480}\\).**\n\nFirst, factor 480 into its prime factors:\n\n\\[\n480 = 2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nPair the factors to simplify the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{(2^4) \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\n\nThus, the radius of the third circle is:\n\n\\[\nr = 4\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the third circle is \\(\\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>4\\sqrt{30}</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The solution provided correctly follows the steps necessary to find the radius of the third circle with an area equal to the shaded region between the two concentric circles. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Area of the Larger Circle**: The calculation for the area of the larger circle with radius 29 is correct:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi \\times 29^2 = \\pi \\times 841 = 841\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the Smaller Circle**: The calculation for the area of the smaller circle with radius 19 is also correct:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi \\times 19^2 = \\pi \\times 361 = 361\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of the Shaded Region**: The area of the shaded region is calculated as the difference between the two areas:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi\n   \\]\n   This step is accurate.\n\n4. **Finding the Radius of the Third Circle**: The area of the third circle is set equal to the area of the shaded region:\n   \\[\n   \\pi r^2 = 480\\pi\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by \\(\\pi\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 480\n   \\]\n   This is correct.\n\n5. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{480}\\)**: The simplification of \\(\\sqrt{480}\\) is done correctly:\n   - The factorization \\(480 = 2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5\\) is accurate.\n   - The simplification to \\(4\\sqrt{30}\\) is also correct, as shown:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer for the radius of the third circle is correctly stated as \\(4\\sqrt{30}\\).\n\nSince all steps are correct and the final answer is accurate, I conclude that the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
