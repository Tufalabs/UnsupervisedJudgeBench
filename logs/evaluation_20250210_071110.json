  "question": "Express $0.4\\overline5$ as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To express the repeating decimal \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) as a common fraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the equation:**\n   Let \\(x = 0.4\\overline{5}\\). This means \\(x = 0.455555\\ldots\\).\n\n2. **Eliminate the repeating part:**\n   Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to shift the decimal point one place to the right:\n   \\[\n   10x = 4.55555\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n3. **Align the repeating decimals:**\n   Multiply both sides of the original equation by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right:\n   \\[\n   100x = 45.5555\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the first equation from the second:**\n   \\[\n   100x - 10x = 45.5555\\ldots - 4.5555\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   90x = 41\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   Divide both sides by 90:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{41}{90}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the repeating decimal \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) as a common fraction is \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{41}{90}\\)</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided for expressing \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) as a common fraction, let's go through the steps outlined in the solution and verify their correctness.\n\n1. **Setting up the equation:**\n   The solution correctly defines \\(x = 0.4\\overline{5}\\), which is indeed \\(x = 0.455555\\ldots\\).\n\n2. **Eliminating the repeating part:**\n   The solution multiplies both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   10x = 4.55555\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This step is correct as it shifts the decimal point one place to the right.\n\n3. **Aligning the repeating decimals:**\n   The solution then multiplies both sides of the original equation by 100:\n   \\[\n   100x = 45.5555\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This step is also correct, as it shifts the decimal point two places to the right.\n\n4. **Subtracting the first equation from the second:**\n   The solution subtracts the first equation from the second:\n   \\[\n   100x - 10x = 45.5555\\ldots - 4.5555\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   90x = 41\n   \\]\n   This step is correct. The subtraction eliminates the repeating decimal part, leaving a simple equation.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   The solution divides both sides by 90:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{41}{90}\n   \\]\n   This step is also correct.\n\nNow, let's verify the final answer by back substitution. We can convert \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\) back into a decimal to check if it matches \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{41}{90}\\):\n- Performing the division \\(41 \\div 90\\) gives approximately \\(0.455555\\ldots\\), which matches \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\).\n\nSince all steps in the solution are correct and the final answer matches the original repeating decimal, we conclude that the solution is accurate.\n\nFinal verdict:\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
