  "question": "Let $C$ be a point not on line $AE$ and $D$ a point on line $AE$ such that $CD \\perp AE.$ Meanwhile, $B$ is a point on line $CE$ such that $AB \\perp CE.$ If $AB = 4,$ $CD = 8,$ and $AE = 5,$ then what is the length of $CE?$",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of \\( CE \\) given the conditions and lengths provided.\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n   - We have a line \\( AE \\) with a point \\( D \\) on it.\n   - \\( C \\) is a point not on \\( AE \\) such that \\( CD \\perp AE \\).\n   - \\( B \\) is a point on line \\( CE \\) such that \\( AB \\perp CE \\).\n   - Given lengths: \\( AB = 4 \\), \\( CD = 8 \\), and \\( AE = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Visualize the Setup:**\n   - Since \\( CD \\perp AE \\), \\( C \\) is directly above or below \\( D \\) by 8 units.\n   - \\( D \\) is on \\( AE \\), and since \\( AE = 5 \\), \\( D \\) can be anywhere on this line.\n   - \\( AB \\perp CE \\) implies that \\( AB \\) is a height from \\( A \\) to line \\( CE \\).\n\n3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - Since \\( CD \\perp AE \\), we can consider triangle \\( ACD \\) where \\( AD \\) is a segment of \\( AE \\).\n   - Let \\( AD = x \\). Then \\( DE = 5 - x \\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\( CE \\):**\n   - In triangle \\( ACD \\), by the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     AC = \\sqrt{AD^2 + CD^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 64}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Consider Triangle \\( ABE \\):**\n   - Since \\( AB \\perp CE \\), triangle \\( ABE \\) is a right triangle with \\( AB = 4 \\).\n   - Let \\( BE = y \\). Then \\( CE = \\sqrt{y^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{y^2 + 16} \\).\n\n6. **Relate \\( CE \\) to \\( AE \\):**\n   - Since \\( AE = 5 \\), and \\( AB \\perp CE \\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\( ABE \\):\n     \\[\n     AE^2 = AB^2 + BE^2 \\implies 5^2 = 4^2 + y^2 \\implies 25 = 16 + y^2 \\implies y^2 = 9 \\implies y = 3\n     \\]\n\n7. **Find \\( CE \\):**\n   - Since \\( BE = 3 \\) and \\( B \\) is on \\( CE \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     CE = \\sqrt{BE^2 + AB^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n     \\]\n\nThus, the length of \\( CE \\) is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>",
  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided, let's go through the steps and reasoning presented in the solution to check for correctness.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: The solution correctly identifies the geometric relationships between points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\). It establishes that \\(CD\\) is perpendicular to \\(AE\\) and that \\(AB\\) is perpendicular to \\(CE\\).\n\n2. **Visualizing the Setup**: The solution accurately describes the positioning of points and the relationships between them. It notes that \\(C\\) is directly above or below \\(D\\) by 8 units, which is correct.\n\n3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**: The solution correctly sets up the relationship in triangle \\(ACD\\) using the Pythagorean theorem. It defines \\(AD = x\\) and calculates \\(AC\\) as \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + 64}\\).\n\n4. **Considering Triangle \\(ABE\\)**: The solution correctly identifies that triangle \\(ABE\\) is a right triangle with \\(AB = 4\\) and uses the Pythagorean theorem to relate \\(AE\\), \\(AB\\), and \\(BE\\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\(BE\\)**: The solution correctly derives \\(y^2 = 9\\) leading to \\(y = 3\\). This means \\(BE = 3\\).\n\n6. **Finding \\(CE\\)**: The solution calculates \\(CE\\) using the relationship \\(CE = \\sqrt{BE^2 + AB^2}\\). Substituting \\(BE = 3\\) and \\(AB = 4\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   CE = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5.\n   \\]\n   This calculation is correct.\n\n7. **Final Result**: The solution concludes that the length of \\(CE\\) is \\(5\\), which matches the calculations made throughout the solution.\n\nOverall, the solution follows a logical progression, correctly applies the Pythagorean theorem, and arrives at the correct final answer. \n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
