  "explanation": "To evaluate the solution provided for the question of how many even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits, we will go through the reasoning step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Range\nThe solution correctly identifies that the thousands digit can be 4, 5, or 6 for numbers between 4000 and 7000.\n\n### Step 2: Ensure the Number is Even\nThe solution correctly states that the units digit must be one of the even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Each Case for the Thousands Digit\nThe solution breaks down the problem into three cases based on the thousands digit (4, 5, and 6). Each case is analyzed separately, which is a logical approach.\n\n#### Case 1: Thousands Digit is 4\n- The units digit can be 0, 2, 6, or 8 (4 cannot be used as it would repeat).\n- The calculations for each sub-case are as follows:\n  - **Sub-case 1.1 (Units Digit 0)**: Correctly identifies 7 remaining choices for hundreds and tens, leading to \\(21 \\times 2 = 42\\).\n  - **Sub-case 1.2 (Units Digit 2)**: Correctly identifies 7 remaining choices, leading to \\(21 \\times 2 = 42\\).\n  - **Sub-case 1.3 (Units Digit 6)**: Correctly identifies 7 remaining choices, leading to \\(21 \\times 2 = 42\\).\n  - **Sub-case 1.4 (Units Digit 8)**: Correctly identifies 7 remaining choices, leading to \\(21 \\times 2 = 42\\).\n- Total for Case 1: \\(42 + 42 + 42 + 42 = 168\\) is correct.\n\n#### Case 2: Thousands Digit is 5\n- The units digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n- The calculations for each sub-case are as follows:\n  - **Sub-case 2.1 (Units Digit 0)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 2.2 (Units Digit 2)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 2.3 (Units Digit 4)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 2.4 (Units Digit 6)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 2.5 (Units Digit 8)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n- Total for Case 2: \\(56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 280\\) is correct.\n\n#### Case 3: Thousands Digit is 6\n- The units digit can be 0, 2, 4, or 8 (6 cannot be used as it would repeat).\n- The calculations for each sub-case are as follows:\n  - **Sub-case 3.1 (Units Digit 0)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 3.2 (Units Digit 2)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 3.3 (Units Digit 4)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n  - **Sub-case 3.4 (Units Digit 8)**: Correctly identifies 8 remaining choices, leading to \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\).\n- Total for Case 3: \\(56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 224\\) is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Totals from All Cases\nThe final total is calculated as follows:\n\\[ 168 + 280 + 224 = 672 \\]\nThis calculation is also correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solution correctly follows the logical steps to arrive at the final answer of 672 even integers between 4000 and 7000 with four different digits. Each case and sub-case is handled correctly, and the arithmetic is accurate.\n\nThus, the final verdict is:\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
