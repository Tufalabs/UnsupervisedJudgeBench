  "question": "What is the sum of all the odd integers between $300$ and $500$?",
  "solution": "To find the sum of all the odd integers between 300 and 500, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the first and last odd integers in the range:**\n   - The first odd integer greater than 300 is 301.\n   - The last odd integer less than 500 is 499.\n\n2. **Determine the sequence of odd integers:**\n   - The sequence of odd integers between 301 and 499 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\( a_1 = 301 \\) and the last term \\( a_n = 499 \\).\n   - The common difference \\( d \\) between consecutive terms is 2 (since the difference between consecutive odd numbers is 2).\n\n3. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**\n   - The general formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the known values:\n     \\[\n     499 = 301 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     499 = 301 + 2n - 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     499 = 299 + 2n\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     200 = 2n\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = 100\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, there are 100 terms in the sequence.\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**\n   - The sum \\( S_n \\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     S_{100} = \\frac{100}{2} \\cdot (301 + 499)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S_{100} = 50 \\cdot 800\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S_{100} = 40000\n     \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all the odd integers between 300 and 500 is \\(\\boxed{40000}\\).\n\n<ANSWER>40000</ANSWER>",

  "explanation": "Let's evaluate the solution step by step to determine if it correctly answers the question about the sum of all odd integers between 300 and 500.\n\n1. **Identifying the first and last odd integers:**\n   - The first odd integer greater than 300 is correctly identified as 301.\n   - The last odd integer less than 500 is correctly identified as 499.\n\n2. **Determining the sequence of odd integers:**\n   - The sequence of odd integers between 301 and 499 is indeed an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\( a_1 = 301 \\) and the last term \\( a_n = 499 \\).\n   - The common difference \\( d \\) is correctly stated as 2.\n\n3. **Finding the number of terms in the sequence:**\n   - The formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is correctly applied:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n     \\]\n   - The substitution and simplification steps are correct:\n     \\[\n     499 = 301 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n     \\]\n     leads to:\n     \\[\n     200 = 2n \\implies n = 100\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, there are indeed 100 terms in the sequence.\n\n4. **Calculating the sum of the sequence:**\n   - The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is correctly used:\n     \\[\n     S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     S_{100} = \\frac{100}{2} \\cdot (301 + 499) = 50 \\cdot 800 = 40000\n     \\]\n   - The calculation of the sum is correct.\n\nFinally, the solution concludes that the sum of all the odd integers between 300 and 500 is \\(\\boxed{40000}\\).\n\nAfter reviewing each step, I can confirm that the solution is correct.\n\n<MARK>1</MARK>",
